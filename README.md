# CONtract - Make CON great again!

This is a tampermonkey script that enhances the UI experience in Conflict Of Nations.

## Disclaimer

This script in no ways alters data, does not intercept data sent to or from the CON servers. It merely tweaks the UI in various ways.


# Why

I made this script to fix the issues that frustrated me and added functionality I thought was lacking and should already exist.


# Features

- Revamped Events window
  - Highlight unread events
  - Filter by type


# Upcoming features

- Events: Filter by country
- Research: List unit type (and not just "BTR-90 has been researched". What is BTR-90?! Instead, show "BTR-90 (Amphibious Combat Vehicle) has been researched")
- Hide gold ads
- Show city morale details right away (if possible)

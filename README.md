# CONfetti - Make CON great again!

This is a tampermonkey script that enhances the UI experience in Conflict Of Nations.

## Disclaimer

This script in no ways alters data, does not intercept data sent to or from the CON servers. It merely tweaks the UI in various ways.


# Why

I made this script to fix the issues that frustrates me and to add functionality I think is lacking and should already exist.


# Features

- Revamped Events window
  - Highlight unread events
  - Filter by type
- Take notes (per game, saved in the browser)
- Hide tutorial advisor in the top-right

# Upcoming features
